            <h1>☻ A little bit about me!</h1><br><br>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I completed my B.A. in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

            <br><h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Product Design Intern at Aquatonomy, where I collaborate with a team of designers to improve the user interface for autonomous robotic systems, focusing on Human-Robot Interaction and underwater environments.</p>
            <p>Previously, I worked as a Product Design Intern at Sabres Media, where I helped develop and test digital prototypes, and as a UX Researcher at the University of Michigan School of Information, contributing to various research projects.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am involved in the Data Science Club at CMU, where I design and develop web features for the Intercollegiate AI Poker Tournament website.</p>
            <br><h2>Future</h2>
            <p>I am excited to explore more ways to combat addictive technology and am eager to dive deeper into product design. Through my studies and hands-on projects, I aim to develop innovative solutions that promote healthy tech usage while refining my skills in UX and product design.</p>

            <br><h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I like to beat my brother at tennis, expand my collection of indoor plants, and dance! At UVA, I was a part of AKAdeMiX, an open-style collegiate dance crew.</p>

            <br><h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>Looking forward, I’ll be graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction! #yayclassof2025</p>

## Feedback Summary

Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words). 

During the lab session, feedback on my projects highlighted their unique aspects and potential for engagement. The dress-up game received particularly positive responses, with many participants appreciating its interactive nature and the opportunity it provides to showcase my personal style and illustrations. However, there were concerns about the project’s ability to support iterative programming effectively. It was noted that creating a meaningful MVP might require considerable work to function end-to-end, which could hinder incremental development. Limiting third-party assets was suggested to streamline the process.

The interactive personal portfolio also garnered interest, especially due to its innovative approach to animations and transitions. Reviewers liked the design elements, such as users hovering over project thumbnails to see brief descriptions and animations transitioning into a detailed view. These features were recognized as aligning well with the project's goal of demonstrating usability skills.

For the guessing game, feedback focused on its overall concept and the potential to integrate interactive elements related to geography. It was suggested that I consider how my design could stand out compared to a standard quiz engine that uses dropdown lists for locations. Encouragement was given to explore creative ways to enhance user engagement beyond basic functionalities, potentially by incorporating unique interactive features that deepen the learning experience.

Overall, the feedback provided valuable insights for refining my projects, clarifying the strengths of each design, and offering directions for further development. Each project has the potential to captivate users in its own unique way, and I’m excited to incorporate these suggestions into my designs.

## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.

The feedback from the lab session has provided valuable insights into all my projects, and I plan to improve upon each design in the next iteration. While I’m particularly drawn to the interactive personal portfolio due to its potential for showcasing my work effectively, I recognize the importance of refining the dress-up game and the guessing game as well.

For the interactive portfolio, I will focus on enhancing the hover interactions and animations that reveal project details, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. This will be a key priority, as it aligns well with the goal of demonstrating my usability skills.

In terms of the dress-up game, I plan to work on illustrating and animating the clothing items to enhance their visual appeal. I will also explore ways to format the game for iterative development, incorporating interactive elements that allow for multiple iterations and user engagement. This could include features like character customization options and scenario-based challenges, ensuring the game remains fresh and enjoyable.

Additionally, I’ll address the feedback on the guessing game by considering how to integrate unique interactive elements, such as visualizing locations on a map or globe. This will not only differentiate my design from standard quiz engines but also deepen the educational aspect of the game.
